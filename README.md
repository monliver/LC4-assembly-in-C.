# LC4-assembly-in-C.
This project is a reverse assembler for LC4 assembly in C. It disassembles binary instructions into human-readable assembly code and involves parsing files, managing linked lists, and generating .asm files. 

The main functions include opening and parsing files, adding nodes to linked lists, searching for nodes by address or opcode, and printing or deleting lists. The code handles various types of instructions and data sections, ensuring correct parsing and memory management, with specific techniques for sign extension, binary parsing, and error handling. The project also logs events and generates assembly code for further analysis.
